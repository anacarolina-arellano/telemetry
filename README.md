### **PG20 T4 Cloud Computing - A3: Telemetry Admin System**
Submitted by: Ana Carolina Arellano

----------
#### **Description of what the project does**
This version of the Warehouse app that I developed during term 3 makes use of firebase in order to store the data of the app in the cloud. The information from all the products is now stored in Firebase and the app retrieves it in order to display it in the "customer" role. Further more, the information entered in the "sales" role is now stored in the cloud too, so the local server implemented in the past submission is no longer used.
